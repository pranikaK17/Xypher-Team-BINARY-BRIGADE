## 🧩 Problem Statement - [ ED-TECH : Problem Statement 2 ]

Educational institutions currently face significant inefficiencies in managing student assignments. Manual grading processes lead to bottlenecks, lack of transparency in evaluation, and limited visibility into academic progress. Students often struggle with unclear feedback and submission tracking, while teachers lack streamlined tools for question-wise marking and performance analytics.



This project has a sample dual-dashboard solution to showcase the digitization & optimization of assignment workflows for both students and teachers.
